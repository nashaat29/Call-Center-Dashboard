# Call Center Dashboard Project with Excel

## Overview

This project is a Call Center Dashboard built in Excel, where I learned various Excel skills and techniques while creating a comprehensive dashboard for a call center. The primary goal was to visualize and analyze call data to gain valuable insights into call center operations.

## Tasks Accomplished

Throughout the project, I accomplished the following tasks:

1. **Data Formatting and Cleaning:**
   - I formatted the raw data to ensure uniformity and ease of analysis.
   - I cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates and irrelevant information.

2. **Extracting Day from Date:**
   - I used Excel functions to extract the day from the date column, which helped in daily performance analysis.

3. **Creating Pivot Tables:**
   - I created pivot tables to summarize and aggregate call data.
   - With pivot tables, I could analyze call volumes, average handling times, and other relevant metrics.

4. **Creating Maps:**
   - I utilized Excel's mapping features to visualize call center data geographically.
   - By creating maps, I gained insights into call distribution across different regions.

5. **Creating Dashboards:**
   - I designed an interactive and informative dashboard that presented key metrics visually.
   - The dashboard included charts, graphs, and other Excel features to create an intuitive user experience.

## Learning Process

To complete this project, I followed these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - I ensured that Microsoft Excel was installed on my computer (version 2013 or later).
   - I obtained the dataset containing call center data.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - I opened the dataset in Excel and reviewed its structure.
   - I learned how to format and clean the data to ensure consistency.

3. **Extracting Day from Date:**
   - I researched and implemented Excel functions or formulas to extract the day from the date column.

4. **Creating Pivot Tables:**
   - I learned how to create pivot tables to summarize and analyze call data effectively.

5. **Creating Maps:**
   - I explored Excel's mapping features and learned how to use them to visualize geographical data.

6. **Creating Dashboards:**
   - I studied dashboard design principles and applied them to create an informative and visually appealing dashboard.

## Conclusion

The Call Center Dashboard project in Excel was an excellent learning experience. I gained valuable skills in data formatting, cleaning, and analysis using pivot tables. Additionally, I learned how to create maps and build interactive dashboards to present insights effectively.

This project has not only improved my Excel proficiency but also enhanced my data visualization and dashboard design abilities. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects and exploring more advanced Excel techniques.
